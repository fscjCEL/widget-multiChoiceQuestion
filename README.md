# Jekyll Managed Learning Object Repository
This is how we will be deploying the protozoa framework alongside our existing learning object reposotory

The assumption is that you have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) installed and running. 

##To get this to work on your local machine
1. Download ZIP version of this repository. 
2. unArchive the ZIP into any directory. 
3. Open a terminal app and navigate to that directory. 
4. Type in "jekyll build" to render the current source site to the _site directory. NOTE: This will render our the entire repository to the _site directory which should now be located under the root directory. Alternately, you can use the command "jekyll serve". This spawns a local web server which you can access using hte URL http://localhost:4000 to see your final site updated in real time locally. 
5. Use FTP to upload the static files to whatever server you want.
